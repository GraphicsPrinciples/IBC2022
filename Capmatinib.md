# Effective Visual Communication (EVC) exercise: Case study

## Efficacy of Capmatinib in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with MET mutations

Background:

 -	Phase 2 study of Capmatinib (MET receptor inhibitor) in NSCLC patients with various MET mutations
 -	Primary endpoint: overall response (complete or partial response) 
 -	Secondary endpoint: duration of response

Key question: 
- Does Capmatinib show meaningful response in patients with various types of MET mutation?
