## Assignment:

For the assignment bring and work on your own example completing the following steps. 

  - **Step 1 (have a clear purpose):** Complete the Purpose Worksheet
    for the example you choose. Partially completed purpose worksheets
    are available for supplied examples. If you choose to bring your own
    example, a blank purpose worksheet is available here:
    [Purpose\_Worksheet.docx](Purpose_Worksheet.docx)
  - **Step 2 (show the data clearly):** Select what data to display, and
    how to display it, iterate through a few alternatives in quick
    sketches
  - **Step 3 (make the message obvious):** Choose a graph or two from
    the previous step, and refine to make the message obvious

**Note:** For steps 2 and 3, you may choose to use pen and paper, or a
drawing, graphing, or coding software. It’s up to you\!

### Back up example - Capmatinib NSCLC MET mutations
